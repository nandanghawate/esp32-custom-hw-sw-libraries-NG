### What is this repository for? ###

* In this Repo I will be uploading the schematics, pcb layouts, test codes and libraries for esp32-rotary-encoder-NG project
* The circuit and codes have not been tested practically yet, needs to be tested on actual hardware.

### How do I get set up? ###

* I use Fritzing software for initial Dev board level circuit design or schematic.
* Download and Install Fritzing - https://fritzing.org/download , https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app
* I use Diptrace for schematics and PCB layouts
* Download and Install Diptrace freeware https://diptrace.com/download/download-diptrace/ 
* Currently(At the time of creating this repository) I use Arduino IDE 1.8.19
* Download and Install Arduino IDE - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
